Building
========

Maratis uses CMake to configure and generate build files. Builds must be made 
outside of the source tree.


Mac OS X
--------

To generate an Xcode project for building Maratis, peform the following steps
to create a build directory outside of the source tree:

  mkdir Build
  cd Build
  cmake -G Xcode ../Maratis

Assuming the Maratis source directory resides in the same top directory.


iOS
---

To generate an Xcode project for building Maratis for iOS, peform the following 
steps to create a build directory outside of the source tree:

  mkdir Build
  cd Build
  cmake -G XCode -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../Maratis/CMake/Toolchains/iOS.cmake \
     ../Maratis

Assuming the Maratis source directory resides in the same top directory. The 
build require that the Xcode generator is used or it will protest with a fatal 
error and quit


Windows
-------

To generate a Microsoft Visual Studio project for building Maratis, perform 
the following steps to create a build directory outside of the source tree:

  mkdir Build
  cd Build
  cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" ../Maratis

Assuming the Maratis source directory resides in the same top directory.


Linux
-----

To generate Makefiles for building Maratis, perform the following steps to 
create a build directory outside of the source tree:

  mkdir Build
  cd Build
  cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../Maratis
  make
  make install

Assuming the Maratis source directory resides in the same top directory.


Android
-------

To generate Makefiles for building Maratis, perform the following steps to 
create a build directory outside of the source tree:

  mkdir Build
  cd Build
  cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" \
     -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../Maratis/CMake/Toolchains/android.cmake \
     -DANDROID_NDK=/path/to/android/ndk
     ../Maratis
  make

Assuming the Maratis source directory resides in the same top directory.
The path to either the Android NDK or a prebuilt Android NDK toolchain need
to be set by either ANDROID_NDK or ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN and can only
be set at the first run of CMake.



Installation
------------

The installation location is dependant on the build platform. E.g. it defaults 
to /usr/local on Linux and c:/Program Files on Windows.

To override it and install Maratis locally you have to set the install prefix 
when running CMake to generate the build files:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/ ../Maratis

This will install the Editor, Player and SDK in a directory called Maratis 
located in your home directory.
